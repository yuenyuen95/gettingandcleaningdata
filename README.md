run_analysis.R is a script that does the following required for the course project:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md contains a code book that describes the data, variables and steps taken to clean and extract the data required for the course project. 

final.txt is the generated tidy dataset that consists of the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
